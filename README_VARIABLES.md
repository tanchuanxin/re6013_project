Our dataset was obtained by running <b>Plant_1_Data.R</b>

The dataset in use is <b>Plant_1_Data.csv</b>

Here are the meanings of the variables in our dataset

1. DATE - the date where the data was measured
2. TIME - the time where the data was measured. Data was measured in 15 minute intervals
3. PLANT_ID - the numeric ID of the plant. We are only dealing with one plant, hence this is all the same
4. SOURCE_KEY - a unique ID for the various inverters in one plant. An inverter can be thought of as a solar panel
5. DC_POWER - the DC power generated
6. AC_POWER - the AC power generated
7. DAILY_YIELD - the energy yield for the day
8. TOTAL_YIELD - the total energy yield throughout the time period of the data collection
9. DOTW - day of the week (Monday, Tuesday etc.)
10. PERIOD_YIELD - the energy yield for the 15 minute period
11. DATE_TIME - the date and time where the data was measured
12. AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE - the surrounding temperature around the solar plant
13. MODULE_TEMPERATURE - the temperature of the solar module
14. IRRADIATION - the light intensity falling on the solar panel
15. Relative Humidity (%) - the relative humidity around the solar plant
16. Pressure (hPa) - the atmospheric pressure around the solar plant
17. Wind speed (m/s) - the wind speed around the solar plant
18. Wind direction - the wind direction around the solar plant
19. Rainfall (kg/m2) - the amount of rainfall around the solar plant
